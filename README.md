# Todo Web Application

## A slightly more complex Todo App

This is a project for me to practice patterns for a single page webapp with a REST backend

The backend is written in Python & Django using the Django REST Framework.

I plan to eventually implement the frontend via React-Redux

### Features
 * User Auhentication through Django backend
 * Ability to create multiple separate todo lists
 * Ability to share lists with other users

### Development
 * Python dependencies are managed via `pipenv`
 * TODO
